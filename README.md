# NLP-Disaster Tweets üê¶
 Welcome, this si my project for the kaggle competition [NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview)

 ## Overview
 The objective of the competition is to use NLP to predictif a disaster is happening at the moment at the location the user tweeted at.

 This project is written in Python using a JupyterNotebook which you can run yourself, my recomendation is to uset he kaggle kernel due to the ease of use with the required libraries.

 The project is based on creation of two deep learning models to evaluate how both handle the text inputs and see how different their outputs are in terms of loss and accuracy.

 ## Libraries
 * Pandas
 * Numpy 
 * Tensorflow v2
 * Keras
